// Undefined
// Null

let name = 'Logan'; // String Literal 
let age = 26; // Number Literal 
let isApproved = true; // Boolean Literal , this can be either true or false!!! (They can not be used as variables because they are reserved keywords)
let firstName = undefined; // Undefined value is given when no value for the variable is inputed, here the variables value is declared as undefined
let selectedColor = null; // Null is used when clearing the value of a certain variable. value can be entered in when figued out.
