# The Web
This is the section designed to show how *CSS*, *HTML*, and *JavaScript* work together to create the sites we use eahc and everyday.

## How it Works


#### URL

* *URL* is short for Uniform Resource Location and is a way to locate a resource on the internet.

### Example

* *URL*: (https://www.github.com/lmoecher/my_projects/blob/master/the_web/README.md) this is the URL that this  webpage uses. 

* These resources can be Web Pages(HTML documents), Images, Video files, Fonts, etc.


#### Client Server Model

* The *Client*(*Browser*) and computers hosting the target website are the *Servers*.

* The *Client* requests a service and the *Server* provides the service. 

* These requests are formatted based on a protocol called *HTTP*.


#### HTTP 

* *HTTP* is short for *Hypertext Transfer Protocol* and is a langauge that *clients* and *servers* use to talk to each other.

* NOT a Programming Language, it's just a plain textual langauge for communicating over the internet.

* *HTTPS* which is *HTTP* with encryption. This is so the messages between a *client* and a *server* are encrypted.

* This message tells the browser what it is looking for.

* When the *server* figures out what the *client* is asking, it will send a message back.

* The first message is an *HTTP Request* and the second message is an *HTTP Request*

### Example 1

* *HTTP Request* 

> GET /index.html HTTP/1.1  (This tends to represent the homepage of websites)
> Host: www.github.com  
> Accept-Language: en-us

### Example 2 

* *HTTP Response*
> HTTP/1.1 200 OK
> Date: 25 Jun 2024 01:51
> Content-Type: text/html

> <!Doctype html>
> <html>
> ...
> <html>
