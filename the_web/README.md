## How it Works


#### URL

* *URL* is short for Uniform Resource Location and is a way to locate a resource on the internet.

### Example

* *URL*: (https://www.github.com/lmoecher/my_projects/blob/master/the_web/README.md) this is the URL that this  webpage uses. 

* These resources can be Web Pages(HTML documents), Images, Video files, Fonts, etc.


#### Client Server Model

* The *Client*(*Browser*) and computers hosting the target website are the *Servers*.

* The *Client* requests a service and the *Server* provides the service. 

* These requests are formatted based on a protocol called *HTTP*.


#### HTTP 

* *HTTP* is short for *Hypertext Transfer Protocol* and is a langauge that *clients* and *servers* use to talk to each other.

* NOT a Programming Language, it's just a plain textual langauge for communicating over the internet.

* *HTTPS* which is *HTTP* with encryption. This is so the messages between a *client* and a *server* are encrypted.

### Example

* *HTTP* Message

> GET /index.html HTTP/1.1  (This tends to represent the homepage of websites)
> Host: WWW.github.com  
> Accept-Language: en-us

* This message tell the browsere what it is looking for.
