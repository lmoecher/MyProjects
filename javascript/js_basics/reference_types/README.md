# Reference Types Description:

* *Reference Types*: are objects that are stored and manipulated via references (or addresses) rather than by their actual values.
* These *Refernce Types* are:
> * Array
> * Function
> * Object



# Array

* *Array*: is a data structure that we use to represent a list of items.
* When using an *Array* index numbers start at 0 not 1, (0,1,2,3).
* "[]" these brackets are called an array literal and indicate an empty array.

### Example

![Array IMG 1](img/array_code_img_1.PNG "Array code IMG 1")

### Output 

##### *Array* application running in the Browser Console

##### *Array* application running in the Command Prompt



# Function

* *Function*: these are a set of statements that perform a task or calculates and returns a value.
* The *parameter* is set at the time of declaration.
* The *argument* is at the actual value that supplies that *parameter*. 
* *Functions* can have multiple *parameters*, to add more use ",".
* Realworld apps have thousands of functions runnning together to provide the functionality of that application.

### Example 

![Function IMG 1](img/function_code_img_1.PNG "Function img 1")




# Objects 

* *Object*: These are the properties of the variables.
* Two ways of changing the name of *person* and accessing the properties.
* *Dot Notation* & *Bracket Notation*.
* Most stick to *Dot Notation* due to it not being as consice as *Bracket Notation*.
