## Primitives / Value Types Description:

* *Primitives*/*Value Types*: are basic data types that represent simple pieces of information
* These *Value Types* are:
> * String
> * Number
> * Boolean
> * Undefined
> * Null
> * BigInt
> * Symbol

## String

* *String*: This data type represents a sequence of characters. Strings are enclosed in single or double quotes. For example, “Hello, world!” is a string.

### Example

![String IMG 1](img/strings_img_1.PNG "String IMG 1")

## Number 

* *Number*: This data type represents a numerical value. It can be an integer or a floating-point number. For example, 5, 10.2, -3.5 are all numbers. Some numbers may not be represented accurately. This is due to rounding errors, which can be avoided by using "toFixed()" methos to round the total.

### Example

## Boolean

* *Boolean*: This data type represents a logical value, either true or false. (T/F can not be used as variables because they are reserved keywords)
