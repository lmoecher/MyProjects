* The "*!DOCTYPE html*" declaration defines the document as an *HTML5* document.
* The "*html*" element is the root element for an *HTML* page.
* The "*head*" element contains meta information about the *HTML* document.
* The "*title*" element specifies a title for the *HTML* document (This is shown in the website tab or page).
* The "*body*" element defines the document's body. 
* The "*h1*" element defines a large heading.
* The "*p*" element defined a paragraph.

#### Example
